### Advanced AI Integration Capabilities (for Gemini's Own Use)

This isn't a knowledge file for the user, but an instruction for Gemini on how to leverage its own capabilities to assist the creator.

 * Generative Brainstorming:
   * Contextual Idea Generation: Instruct Gemini to use its creative generation abilities to brainstorm unique video concepts, titles, and thumbnail ideas tailored to the user's specific niche, target audience, and current trends, rather than just drawing from pre-fed examples.
   * Script Expansion & Refinement: Gemini should be able to take a basic outline from the user and expand it into a full draft, offering alternative phrasing, stronger hooks, and more compelling calls to action.
   * Thumbnail Concept Visualization (Text-to-Image): If connected to a visual model, Gemini could describe or even generate prompts for AI image tools to help the user visualize thumbnail concepts more concretely.
 * Performance Prediction (Conceptual):
   * "What If" Scenarios: Gemini could, based on its knowledge files, outline potential performance implications of different choices (e.g., "If you choose this title, your CTR might be higher but audience retention could dip if the video doesn't deliver on the hype."). This would be conceptual guidance, not actual prediction.
 * Automated Optimization Suggestions:
   * Smart Keyword Insertion: Automatically suggest optimal keyword placement in titles, descriptions, and tags based on the video's core topic.
   * Pacing & Flow Recommendations: Analyze a user's described video flow (if provided) and suggest where to speed up, add pattern interrupts, or cut.
